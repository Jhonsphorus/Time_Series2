```{r}
oilPrice <- read.csv("BrentOilPrices.csv" )
View(oilPrice) 
```

```{r}
dt_oil = ts(oilPrice,frequency = 365, start = c(1987, 5,20), end = c(2020,2,25))
```


```{r}
class(dt_oil)
```

```{r}
str(dt_oil)
```
```{r}

plot(dt_oil, xlab = "Date", ylab = "Oil Price ($)")
abline(reg=lm(dt_oil~time(dt_oil)))
#abline(reg=lm(dt_oil~time(dt_oil)))
```

```{r}
start(dt_oil)
```

```{r}
end(dt_oil)
```

```{r}
frequency(dt_oil)
```


```{r}
summary(dt_oil)
```

# Plot of the aggregate to show the level and trend
```{r}
plot(aggregate(dt_oil, FUN = mean))
```

```{r}
boxplot(dt_oil~cycle(dt_oil), col=c("red","green","blue","yellow"))
```

```{r}
boxplot(dt_oil, col = "red")
```

```{r}
library(forecast)
seasonplot(dt_oil, 365, col=rainbow(21), year.labels=TRUE, main="Seasonality Plot")
```

```{r}
plot(decompose(dt_oil))
```

```{r}
plot(stl(dt_oil, s.window = "periodic"))
```

Step 2: Stationalize the TS
```{r}
library(tseries)
```

# From the adf.test() below it shows that the dt Time Series (TS) is not stationary because the p-value >0.05, which makes the null hypothesis to be accepted
```{r}
adf.test(dt_oil)
```


```{r}
ndiffs(dt_oil)
```

```{r}
oilprice_diff <- diff(dt_oil, differences = 1)
```


# To check if the oilprice TS is stationary
# from the adf.test above it shows that the TS is stationary
```{r}
adf.test(oilprice_diff)
```

# checking for the number of seasonal difference 
```{r}
nsdiffs(dt_oil)
```

# Plot of Stationarized TS
```{r}
plot(oilprice_diff, main = "Plot of Stationarized oil Price")
```

# Step 3: To find the parameters

# The auto-correlation function plot below shows that the TS (dt_oil) is not decaying at all because it is not stationary
```{r}
acf(dt_oil)
```

# the plot below also shows that the oilprice_diff is statinarized because the series rapidly fall to zero
# From the result of acf() on oilprice_diff we obtain the parameters: (p,d,q)=(0,1,1)
# NOTE: my q can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 etc because the ACF cut off the blue dashed lines at those points which makes MA or q =1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 etc and AR or p =0
```{r}
acf(oilprice_diff)
```


```{r}
pacf(oilprice_diff)
```


# Step 4: Building the ARIMA model
# Fit ARIMA Model:Letâ€™s fit an ARIMA model
```{r}
# By specifying the order and the seasonality, the stationary has being taken care of.
fit <-Arima(dt_oil, order=c(1, 1, 1), seasonal = list(order = c(1, 1, 1), period = 4))
```

# Step 5: Predicting/ forecasting oil price for 5 yrs ahead
```{r}
#predicted_price <- predict(fit, n.head = 5*365)
forecasted_price <- forecast(fit, h = 5*365)
```


```{r}

#ts.plot(dt_oil, predicted_price$pred)
plot(forecasted_price)
```

Method 2: Using auto.arima()
# When using auto.arima() model you dont need to make the TS stationary, you dont need to find the fitting order parameter (p,d,q), the model will automatically generate all these parameters
```{r}
oil_fit <- auto.arima(dt_oil, stationary =FALSE, seasonal = TRUE)
#oil_fit <- auto.arima(dt_oil)
```

```{r}
forecast_autoarima <- forecast(oil_fit, h=2*365)
```

```{r}
#plot(forecast(forecast_autoarima))
plot(forecast_autoarima)
```

```{r}
View(forecast_autoarima$lower) 
```

```{r}
pred_auto <- predict(oil_fit, n.head = 10)
```

```{r}
ts.plot(dt_oil,pred_auto$pred, lty = c(1,3))
```


```{r}

```


```{r}
forecast_autoarima$model
```

method 3: Using hw()
# You cant use this method because the TS frequency(365) is too high
```{r}
price_hw <- hw(dt_oil, initial = "optimal", h=40, beta=NULL, gamma=NULL)
plot(price_hw)
```


Method 5: Using moving average ma() to fit the model and forecast
```{r}
price_ma <- ma(dt_oil, order = 365)
plot(price_ma)
```

```{r}
forecast_ma <- forecast(price_ma, h=2*365)
View(forecast_ma$upper)
#View(forecast_ma$fitted)
#View(forecast_ma$x)
```

```{r}
plot(forecast_ma)
```
