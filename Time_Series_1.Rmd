# Time Series
```{r}
# Time series dataset
data("AirPassengers") # Time series dataset
```


```{r}
str(AirPassengers)
class(AirPassengers)
```


```{r}
summary(AirPassengers)
```


```{r}
boxplot(AirPassengers, col = "green")
```

# Time series plot
```{r}
#View(AirPassengers)
plot(AirPassengers)
```

# Alternative function for plotting time series
```{r}
plot.ts(AirPassengers, col="red", xlab="Time (Year)" )
```

# More examples:
```{r}
library(timeSeries)
```


```{r}
datasets::mdeaths # time series dataset
```


```{r}
#plot(mdeaths)
plot.ts(mdeaths)

```

# Example: 
```{r}
data("MSFT")
```

```{r}
MSFT
```

```{r}
plot(MSFT)
```

```{r}
#plot(MSFT)
plot(MSFT[, c("High","Low","Close","Open")], plot.type = "single",lty=c("solid","dotted","solid","dotted"), col = c("red","blue","yellow","black"))
```


For multivariate time series, we can decide to plot the series separately with a common time axis (plot.type="multiple") or on a single plot (plot.type="single").

```{r}
#plot(MSFT[,c("High","Low")])
plot(MSFT[,c("High","Low")],plot.type = "multiple" )
```


```{r}
plot(MSFT[,c("High","Low")],plot.type = "single" )
```

# The output of this plot for the 'high' values(green straight line) is because its values are far lesser than # that of the volume and they are using common axis
```{r}
plot(MSFT[, c("High","Volume")], plot.type="single", col = c("green","red"))
```


```{r}
plot(MSFT[, c("High","Volume")], plot.type="multiple")
```

# Plotting two time series on th same graph with different vertical axes
```{r}
plot(MSFT[, "High"])
par(new = TRUE) # Not clean the frame before drawing
plot(MSFT[, "Volume"], axes = FALSE, ann = FALSE, col = "green")
axis(4) # New axis on the right-hand side
mtext("Volume", 4) # Is used to write text into the margins of a plot

```

# More Examples
```{r}
dt1 <- boot::acme
dt1
```

  
```{r}
plot.ts(dt1[, c("market","acme")], plot.type = "single", col=c("red","green"))
```

# Creating "time series" object
```{r}
prices <- c(132.45, 130.85,20,5,120, 130.00, 129.55, 130.85,3,50)
dates <- as.Date(c("2010-01-04","2010-01-05","2010-01-06","2010-01-07","2010-01-08","2010-01-09", "2010-01-10", "2010-01-11","2010-01-12","2010-01-13"))
market <- as.ts(prices,dates)

```

# Time Series Analysis
# Creating Time Series
```{r}
a  <- ts (1:1000, frequency = 12, start = 1990) # freq 12 => Monthly data. 
```


```{r}
b = rnorm(1000)
c <- ts (b,frequency = 12, start = c(1990, 1)) # freq 12 => Monthly data. 
#c
```


```{r}
plot(c, col="pink", ylab="Temperature (Celsius)" )
```

# How to extract the trend, seasonality and error?
# In time series data, seasonality is the presence of variations that occur at  specific regular intervals less than a year, such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Seasonality may be caused by various factors, such as weather, vacation, and holidays[1] and consists of periodic, repetitive, and generally regular and predictable patterns in the levels[2] of a time series.
```{r}
data("EuStockMarkets")
#tsData <- EuStockMarkets[, c(1:2)] # ts data
tsData <- EuStockMarkets[,1] # ts data
#tsData <- EuStockMarkets
tsData
```


```{r}
# use type = "additive" for additive components
decomposedRes <- decompose(tsData, type="mult") 
```

```{r}
# decomposedRes # see plot below

```

```{r}
plot(tsData)
```

```{r}
plot (decomposedRes) # see plot below

```

# Alternative method of decomposing time series object
```{r}
# stl() decomposes time series into seasonal, trend and irregular (loess)
stlRes <- stl(tsData, s.window = "periodic")
stlRes
```


```{r}
plot(stlRes)
```

# How to create lags of a time-series ?
# Lagging mean the time series is behind due to shifting of the time base. It can either be made to lag(e.g.lag(-3)) or lead(e.g.lag(3)) by using the lag() function
```{r}
# shifted 3 periods earlier. Use `-3` to shift by 3 periods forward.
laggedTS <- lag(tsData, 3) 
```

```{r}
head(laggedTS)
```

```{r}
plot(laggedTS)
```

```{r}
library(DataCombine)

```

```{r}
#library(DataCombine)
myDf <- as.data.frame(tsData)
#myDf <- slide(myDf, "x", NewVar = "xLag1", slideBy = -1)
myDf <- slide(myDf, "x", NewVar = "xLag1", slideBy = -1)  # create lag1 variable
myDf <- slide(myDf, "x", NewVar = "xLead1", slideBy = 3)  # create lead1 variable
head(myDf)
```


```{r}
plot(myDf)
```

# Autocorrelation is the correlation of a Time Series with lags of itself.
# there is significant autocorrelation for all the lags shown on x-axis because they all crossed the dashed blue line
```{r}
# both acf() and pacf() generates plots by default
acfRes <- acf(AirPassengers) # autocorrelation
```

# Partial Autocorrelation is the correlation of the time series with a lag of itself, with the linear dependence of all the lags between them removed.
# The part of the lag that do not cross the dashed blue line do not correlate with the previous observation ().
```{r}
# pacf() - partial autocorrelation function
pacfRes <- pacf(AirPassengers)  # partial autocorrelation
```

# Cross-correlation function: Is used to check the correlation between two time series 
```{r}
# computes cross correlation between 2 timeseries.
ccfRes <- ccf(mdeaths, fdeaths, ylab = "cross-correlation")

```

# How to de-trend a time series ?
```{r}
# when modelling a time series with linear regression(lm) it must covered the whole #length of the time series object E.g. 84 in the dataset of "JohnsonJohnson"
trModel <- lm(JohnsonJohnson ~ c(1:length(JohnsonJohnson)))
# trModel <- lm(JohnsonJohnson ~ c(1:84)) # Alternatively
#trModel
```

# Plot of the time series of "JohnsonJohnson" time series dataset
```{r}
plot(JohnsonJohnson)
```

# Plot of the de-trend "JohnsonJohnson" time series dataset i.e. the trend has been removed only contain residuals (errors)
```{r}
plot(trModel$residuals, type="l")
#plot(resid(trModel), type="l")  # resid(trModel) contains the de-trended series.
```


# De-seasonalizing throws insight about the seasonal pattern in the time series and helps to model # the data without the seasonal effects.
# How to de-seasonalize a time series in R
# Step 1: Decompose the Time series using forecast::stl() 
# Step 2: use seasadj() from ‘forecast’ package to de-seasonalize the decomposed Time series.
```{r}
# Loading the require library for de-seasonal process
library(forecast)
```


```{r}
TS <- AirPassengers
dec_dt1 <- stl(TS, s.window = "periodic") # decompose the TS
deseason_dt1 <- seasadj(dec_dt1) # de-seasonalize
```


```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

# original series
plot(AirPassengers, type="l", main="Time-Series of Original AirPassengers") 

# seasonal adjusted
plot(deseason_dt1, type = "l", main = "De-seasonize AirPassenger ",ylab="deseasoned dt1")  

```

# Season plot: Season plot of Original time series and the de-seasonized (adjusted TS) base on year

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2) )
seasonplot(deseason_dt1, 12, col=rainbow(12), year.labels=TRUE, main="Seasonal plot:Deseasonized Airpassengers")

seasonplot(AirPassengers, 12, col=rainbow(12), year.labels=TRUE, main="Seasonal plot: Original Airpassengers")
```

# How to test if a time series is stationary
# We use Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (adf test). A p-Value of less than 0.05 in adf.test() indicates that it is stationary.
# if p-value < 0.05 is stationary i.e. null hypothesis is rejected & alternate hypothesis is accepted
# if p-value >= 0.05 is not stationary i.e. null hypothesis is accepted & alternate hypothesis is rejected
```{r}
library(tseries)
```


```{r}
# p-value < 0.05 indicates the 'deseason_dt1' is stationary
# the default is "stationary"
# since it is stationary that means it is devoid or free of trend and seasonal
adf.test(deseason_dt1, alternative = c("stationary","explosive"))
```

# Since p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected while the alternative hypothesis is accepted which show that 'AirPassengers' is stationary
```{r}
# p-value < 0.05 indicates the 'AirPassengers' is stationary
adf.test(AirPassengers) 

```


```{r}
adf.test(tsData) # p-value < 0.05 indicates the 'tsData' is not stationary
# kpss.test(tsData)
```


```{r}
kpss.test(tsData)
```

# How to make a time series stationary
```{r}
library(forecast)

```

# Seasonal Differencing
```{r}

nsdiffs(AirPassengers)  # number for seasonal differencing needed
```


```{r}
# seasonal differencing
AirPassengers_seasdiff <- diff(AirPassengers, lag=frequency(AirPassengers), differences=1)  
```


```{r}
plot(AirPassengers_seasdiff, type="l", main="Seasonally Differenced")  # still not stationary!
```


```{r}
seasonplot(AirPassengers_seasdiff) # Showing that it is not stationary
```

```{r}
seasonplot(AirPassengers_seasdiff, 12, col=rainbow(12), year.labels=TRUE, main="Seasonal plot: Already differenced season")
```


# Since AirPassengers_seasdiff p-value = 0.09899, that shows that it is not stationary
```{r}
adf.test(AirPassengers_seasdiff)
```

# Another confirmation for stationary
```{r}
# The autocorrelation function 'acf()' shows that it is not stationary because it falls gradually to zero

AirPassengers_seasdiff_acf <- acf(AirPassengers_seasdiff)
```

# Make it stationary
```{r}

ndiffs(AirPassengers_seasdiff)  # number of differences need to make it stationary
```


```{r}
stationaryTS <- diff(AirPassengers_seasdiff, differences= 1)

# appears to be stationary
plot(stationaryTS, type="l", main="Differenced and Stationary")  
```


```{r}
#seasonplot(stationaryTS)
```


```{r}
seasonplot(stationaryTS, 12, col=rainbow(12), year.labels=TRUE, main="Seasonal Plot: Stationary AirPassenger")
```

# p-value = 0.01, that shows that it is stationary i.e. it is devoid of trend and season
```{r}
library(tseries)
adf.test(stationaryTS)
```


# Confirmation to show that 'stationaryTS' is stationary because it rapidly falls to zero
```{r}

acf(stationaryTS)
```

# Time Series Forecasting
# Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.

# A. Simple Moving Average: Simple moving average can be calculated using ma() from forecast. The moving average smoother averages the nearest order periods of each observation
```{r}
sm <- ma(AirPassengers, order=12) # 12 month moving average
plot(sm, col="red", type="l") # plot
#lines.ts(sm, col="red", type="l") # plot
```


# B. Exponential Smoothing: Simple, Double and Triple exponential smoothing can be performed using the HoltWinters() function. There are multiple implementations of the Holt Winters method – hw() {forecast} and ets().
```{r}
# Simple exponential smoothing (SES): Level Only
# For SES (you dont supply value for the argument alpha)
# h is the number of periods to forecast
model <- hw(AirPassengers, initial = "optimal", h=24, beta=NULL, gamma=NULL)
# View(model$fitted)
plot(model)
```


```{r}
# Double Exponential smoothing (DES): It will smoothen Level and Trend components
# # For DES (you dont supply value for the argument alpha and beta)
model <- hw(AirPassengers, initial = "optimal", h=24, gamma=NULL)
plot(model)

```

# Table showing the forecasted values and the year
```{r}
#A <- data.frame(model$x, model$upper,model$lower)
A <- data.frame(model)
View(A)
```


```{r}
# Holt Winters: It will smoothen Level, Trend and Seasonality
# # For Holt winters (you dont supply value for the argument alpha, beta and gamma)
model <- hw(AirPassengers, initial = "optimal", h=24)
plot(model)
accuracy(model) # calculate accuracy measures

```

# Triple exponential smoothing
```{r}
# Holt Winters: It will smoothen  Level, Trend and Seasonality
model <- hw(stationaryTS, initial = "optimal", h=120 )
plot(model)
accuracy(model) # calculate accuracy measures

```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(model$upper, col = model$level, ylab= "No of forecast Passenger",xlab="accuracy level", main = "Upper Limit Prediction Intervals")

boxplot(model$lower, col = model$level, ylab= "No of forecast Passenger",xlab="accuracy level", main = "Lower Limit Prediction Intervals")
```

```{r}

model <- hw(deseason_dt1, initial = "optimal", h=24 )
plot(model)
accuracy(model) # calculate accuracy measures

```

# ARIMA - AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average

#1. auto.arima() function
```{r}
# Fit and forecast with auto.arima()
# autoArimaFit <- auto.arima(stationaryTS)
autoArimaFit <- auto.arima(AirPassengers)
autoArimaFit <- forecast(autoArimaFit, h=20)
plot(autoArimaFit)
#plot(forecast(autoArimaFit, h=20))

```

# View the forecast for another 20 months at different accuracy 80(High & Low),90 (High & low) and point forecast (median)
```{r}
View(data.frame(autoArimaFit))
```


```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(autoArimaFit$lower, ylab="No of Passengers", col=autoArimaFit$level )
boxplot(autoArimaFit$upper, ylab="No of Passengers", col=autoArimaFit$level)
```

#2. Arima() function
```{r}
# Fit and forecast with Arima()
arimaFit <- Arima(AirPassengers,order=c(3,1,0))
plot(forecast(arimaFit,h=20))
```

# How To Forecast ARIMA Models With Long Seasonality (Greater Than 350 Periods)
CASE 1: 
```{r}
Fit <- Arima(AirPassengers,order=c(3,1,0))  # fit Arima model
plot(forecast(Fit,h=20))
```
# Fitting auto.arima() on the TS (AirPassengers)
```{r}
# fit auto.arima model
#dt <- c(AirPassengers)
Fit <- auto.arima(AirPassengers, seasonal=FALSE)
#Fit <- auto.arima(AirPassengers, seasonal=FALSE, xreg=fourier(AirPassengers,4))
plot(forecast(Fit,h=20))

```

# CASE 2: Alternative method 
```{r}
pred <- predict (Fit, newxreg=newXregVar) # alternate way to forecast
plot(forecast(Fit, h=20, xreg=fourierf(AirPassengers,4,h=20))) # h is number of forecasts
