# Load dataset
```{r}
data("JohnsonJohnson")
dt <- JohnsonJohnson
```

# Exploratory analysis
```{r}
start(dt)
```
```{r}
end(dt)
```

```{r}
frequency(dt)
```

```{r}
summary(dt)
```

Step 1: Visualize TS
```{r}
#dt <- log(dt)
plot(dt)
abline(reg=lm(dt~time(dt)) )
```
# Plot of the aggregate to show the level and trend
```{r}
plot(aggregate(dt, FUN = mean))
```

```{r}
boxplot(dt~cycle(dt), col=c("red","green","blue","yellow"))
```

# Inference/Observation:
1. The mean of the TS is not constant, but very close btw second quarter to fourth quarter 
2. The mean values is different for each quarter and the variance is very small to the extent that there is no significant variance between second and third quarter, showing that there is seasonality. 
3. There is no seasonality between second and third quarter (plot 3)
4. The trend shows that the  earning on the share has been increasing year on year (plot 2)
5. There is an outlier in the first quarter
```{r}
library(forecast)
seasonplot(dt, 4, col=rainbow(21), year.labels=TRUE, main="Seasonality Plot")
```

```{r}
plot(stl(dt, s.window = "periodic"))
```

Step 2: Stationalize the TS
```{r}
library(tseries)
```

# From the adf.test() below it shows that the dt Time Series (TS) is not stationary because the p-value >0.05, which makes the null hypothesis to be accepted
```{r}
#adf.test(dt)
adf.test(log(dt))
```
# find the number of difference to remove
```{r}
ndiffs(dt)
#ndiffs(log(dt))
```
# Removing the lag to make the TS stationary
```{r}
#dt_diff <- diff(dt, differences = 1)
dt_diff <- diff(log(dt), differences = 1)
```

# Plot of the stationarized TS
```{r}
plot(dt_diff)
```

# Testing to check for stationarity
# From the result below the TS has been stationalized since p-value = 0.01421 which makes the null hypothesis to be rejected
```{r}
adf.test(dt_diff)
```

# Step 3: To find the parameters

# Th rate of decaying to zero is very low because dt is not stationalize
```{r}
acf(dt)
```

# carry out acf() on dt_diff to obtain the parameters: (p,d,q)=(0,1,2)
# NOTE: my q can be 1,2,3,4 or 5 because the ACF cut off the blue dashed lines at those points which makes MA or q =1,2,3,4,or 5, AR or p =0
```{r}
acf(dt_diff)
```

```{r}
pacf(dt_diff)

```

```{r}
# By specifying the order and the seasonality, the stationary has being taken care of.
dt_fit <- arima(dt, order=c(2, 1, 0),seasonal = list(order = c(2, 1, 0), period = 4))

```


```{r}
pred <- predict(dt_fit, n.ahead = 10*4)
```


```{r}
ts.plot(JohnsonJohnson,pred$pred,lty = c(1,3))
#ts.plot(JohnsonJohnson,pred$pred)
```

Alternatively:
```{r}
model1 <- hw(dt, initial = "optimal", h=40, beta=NULL, gamma=NULL)
plot(model1)
```

```{r}
model2 <- hw(dt_diff, initial = "optimal", h=40, gamma=NULL)
plot(model2)
```

```{r}
model3 <- hw(dt_diff, initial = "optimal", h=40)
plot(model3)
```

Alternative 3:
```{r}
dt_arima <- auto.arima(dt)
dt_forecast <- forecast(dt_arima, h=10*4)
plot(dt_forecast)
```
